A hands-on guide to using Amazon Q CLI with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to automate DevOps workflows, generate AWS architecture diagrams, Terraform code, and Kubernetes resources using AI.





# 🚀 Amazon Q CLI with MCP Servers – AI-Powered DevOps Automation

This repository demonstrates how to integrate **Amazon Q CLI** with **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers** to build powerful, AI-driven DevOps and cloud automation workflows.

After Anthropic announced the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, there has been growing interest in extending AI coding assistants with external tools and domain-specific context.  
This project shows how Amazon Q CLI can leverage MCP servers to generate **AWS architecture diagrams, Terraform infrastructure, Kubernetes resources**, and more — all using natural language prompts.
